            hi, i'm viktoriya! whenever i'm not doing schoolwork, 
            i spend a lot of my time in lab (i work as an undergrad 
            researcher in the savage lab in the mcb department)
            where i'm part of a project working on improving 
            photosynthesis efficiency in rice.
            whenever i'm not in lab i like to crochet, draw/paint, and
            play chill games (stardew valley!!). some other things i like are 
            studio ghibli movies, cats, frogs, and picnics!

            <li>i learned that hierarchy is important in the design of a page, as it highlights specific parts that the developer wants the viewer to be drawn to first. 
                i also learned that hierarchy can be in the form of shape and size, color, chronology (what a viewer does first and what comes up next), and others.</li>
            <li>structurally, i liked how the author uses gifs and images to provide visual evidence for the points they're making.
                i think this is really important when they're talking about design.
                content-wise, i liked how they presented a bunch of design rules/guidelines, but then at the end they say to know the rules so you can break them.
