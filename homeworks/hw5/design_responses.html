                            <p> UI interaction seems to be really important in visual hierarchy.
                                I thik a common theme in most of the examples was that the main element 
                                that's most important and central to the hierarchy, is mostly stationary, and easy to keep track of, 
                                while other elemtents and animations are there to afcilitate and enhance the main element.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked the variety of examples, both in content, and different effects and animations.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the netflix design, because of how tailored the animations/effects were to the content.
                                The thumbnail of the advertized show has a person who seems to be searching for something/investigating 
                                and the effect of moving your cursor really fits that theme as it covers more/less of the image as you move around
                                with the cursor. This gives you the feeling of being in the thumbnail's scene itself, which I think achieves the 
                                goal to draw in more viewers to watch the show. </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>8, I feel like I would have prefered more examples.</p>
