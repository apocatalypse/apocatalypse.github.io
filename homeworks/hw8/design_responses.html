				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that dark patterns are design choices made to mislead
							and deceive the users in order to trick them into doing something they wouldn't do otherwise.
							I also learned that this is something that happens not only on the web, but also in
							other aspects of life.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the list of the different types of dark patterns we see
							on the internet. I was aware of dark patterns, but this really put into perspective
							how used we are getting to these types of misleading tricks. To me a lot of these
							things I have learned either to ignore, like email subscriptions or mmisdirectioning,
							or to anticipate and make sure I won't fall into the trap, like hidden costs and forced continuity. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>“ Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.”</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
